Image Data Augmentation using Keras
This repository demonstrates how to apply data augmentation on images using TensorFlow and Keras. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. It helps improve the performance and robustness of machine learning models, particularly when training data is limited.

Features:
Rotation: Random rotations (up to 40 degrees) are applied to images.
Shifting: Horizontal and vertical shifts (up to 20% of the image's width and height).
Shearing: Random shearing transformations to simulate slight geometric distortions.
Zooming: Random zooming (up to 20%) to simulate scale variations.
Flipping: Horizontal flips for data variability.
Brightness Adjustment: Random changes in the image's brightness.
Code Overview:
The code uses Keras' ImageDataGenerator class to apply various augmentations on a sample image. These augmentations are applied in real-time as the model trains, allowing the model to see slightly different variations of the same image during each epoch. This improves the generalization of the model and reduces the risk of overfitting.

How to Use:
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install tensorflow
Replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' in the code with the path to your own image.

Run the script to generate augmented images and visualize them using Matplotlib.

Use Case:
This approach can be helpful for training deep learning models for computer vision tasks such as classification, object detection, and segmentation. By applying augmentations like rotation, shifting, and flipping, you can significantly increase the diversity of your training data without needing additional labeled images.
